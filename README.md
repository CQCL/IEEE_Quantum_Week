You can run the notebooks starting the jupyer server from within the virtual environment with

```bash
poetry run jupyter notebook
```

- [`graphviz`](https://graphviz.org/download/): install it with your distribution packages, as suggested. For Windows, either download the binaries or use the wonderful [scoop](https://scoop.sh/) (`scoop install graphviz`).
